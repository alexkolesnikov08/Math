# Math/engine.py
"""
Engine module for solving mathematical equations expressed in LaTeX.

The module provides a high‑level ``generate_solution_steps`` function that takes a
LaTeX string, parses it, solves it (symbolically and numerically when possible),
and returns a list of LaTeX strings representing each step of the solution.

Typical usage::

    from engine import generate_solution_steps

    latex_input = r"x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0"
    steps = generate_solution_steps(latex_input)
    for step in steps:
        print(step)

The implementation relies on **SymPy** for symbolic manipulation and parsing.
All public functions follow the Google Python style guide.
